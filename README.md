Aquadaily is an app that sends notification reminders for both hydration and general well-being purposes. People affected by the pandemic are our target audience (potential users). Based on research, hydration is one of the key weapons in the fight against COVID-19. So, we wanted to remind people that itâ€™s extremely important to stay hydrated. Meanwhile, we believe that mental health is another important issue that needs to be addressed. So we are not only reminding people to drink more water, but also sending them positive reminders to make them feel motivated throughout the day.

Make sure you have Python libraries plyer and Pillow installed to run the code!
